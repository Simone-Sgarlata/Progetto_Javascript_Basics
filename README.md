DESCRIPTION 
This project is a counter with javascrip, html and css. I added the font-awesome library to add icons to my buttons. I initialize the counter to 0 so when the user enter in the project it visualize the 0 number. The first button can increase the number one by one, the second button can decrease the number one by one and the last button can reset the counter to 0.
